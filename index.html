                problemSolution: "The Problem On large infrastructure projects, time-critical hazards often go undetected until they cause costly delays — like trench flooding from overnight rainfall. Field engineers log reports, but without real-time interpretation or alerting, response is slow. At the same time, project managers lack a consistent, system-wide view of emerging risks. Daily briefs are often assembled manually, inconsistently, or not at all — reducing confidence, situational awareness, and coordination.How We Identified the GapBy reviewing incident logs and day-start routines across roles, we saw two repeated friction points: Hazards were being recorded — but not escalated.Briefings were being written — but not informed by live system context.We saw an opportunity to address both with targeted, intelligent automation that leveraged existing field data.The Solution :We designed two connected capabilities powered by Salesforce Agentforce:🛰️ GeoSentinel_Agent (agentic):Triggered by new case entries, this Agentforce agent detects hazard types based on field data, checks GIS overlays or weather forecasts via Apex, and raises alerts. If risk is confirmed, it generates a Gemini-based impact summary, creates a follow-up task, and pings the project manager via Slack.🧠 Briefing Intelligence (non-agentic, Gemini-based):Built using Prompt Builder, this intelligence scans across agent activity logs, tasks, and unresolved case data to produce a clean daily summary. It contextualises site risks, flags stale follow-ups, and delivers briefing content ready for PM dashboards or mobile delivery.Together, they close the loop between risk detection and risk communication — helping teams act faster and align earlier, without additional manual effort.",

                problemSolution: "University students often struggle with academic advice due to overburdened advisors, fragmented systems and impersonal communications, leading to delays, inconsistent guidance, and frustration. Tasks like checking degree progress or course enrollment are complicated by navigating multiple platforms or reading through dense policies, causing slow responses and limited personalised planning.Our AI Academic Advisor solution, built on Salesforce's Education Data Architecture (EDA), unifies student data. An Agentforce Agent embedded in the Experience Cloud student portal provides real-time, tailored support. This agent uses Prompt Templates for key topics, like summarizing academic progress and recommending courses for the next semester, all grounded in EDA records. Flows retrieve and update EDA information (e.g., current enrollments, course registrations). These prompt templates and flows are actions defined for the AI agent to perform while being interacted with by the student.Integrated with Gemini, the agent interprets natural language queries, summarises complex data, and reasons across inputs. This empowers students with immediate, personalised advice, freeing advisors to focus on complex issues. The AI can answer questions such as ""Am I on track to graduate?"" and initiate actions like enrollment updates via Flows, reducing administrative work. This blend of structured automation and generative AI transforms disconnected data into efficient, personal, and scalable student support, significantly reducing advisor admin time.",
