The Problem: Finding Quality Issues Too Late\nUser Pain: Managers had to manually check logs and often only found a problem after a product batch was already ruined.\nOur Solution: Our AI Agent proactively analyzes the data. As shown in our demo, it can spot a slow temperature drop that a person might miss and recommends a fix before the batch is spoiled. This changes their job from reactive to proactive.\n\n2. The Problem: Wasting Surplus Milk\nUser Pain: Planners used messy spreadsheets to guess how much milk was needed, often leading to wasted surplus.\nOur Solution: The agent instantly analyzes supply and demand. It provides a smart, profitable suggestion, like \"make milk powder,\" turning potential waste into a valuable product.\n\n3. The Problem: Too Much Manual Work\nUser Pain: Employees spent hours digging through data and creating reports instead of doing more important work.\nOur Solution: The agent automates this analysis. A task that took hours now takes seconds. This frees up the team to focus on improving the business, not just reporting on it.",

Increase Profit: The agent turns surplus raw materials into valuable goods, creating new revenue from potential waste.\n\n3. Save Employee Time: We estimate saving 15-20 hours per manager each month by automating data analysis, letting them focus on growth.\n\n4. Reduce Big Risks: The agent acts as a safety net, drastically lowering the chance of a multi-million dollar product recall or compliance fine.",
                bestCollaboration: "While some teams distributed work, we cross-pollinated knowledge.\nOur BAs tested prompts and our Devs joined the demo dry runs. We had less time than most, but we made it up by removing the “that’s not my job” mindset.\nEven Google Gemini would’ve predicted our success if it saw our Slack thread.\n\nHere’s what made us click:\n1. Shared Notion Board for async work.\n2. 15-minute morning sync + evening blocker call.\n3. Apex code pair-review by QA & Dev (unusual but powerful).\n\nIn short, our AI Agent wasn’t the only one collaborating across functions—we mirrored it ourselves.",
                bestAI: "We believe our solution represents the best use of AI because we moved beyond a simple chatbot and created a specialized, data-driven business partner.\n1. Deep Data Grounding for Relevant Answers:\nOur AI doesn't guess. We grounded it directly in Salesforce data by writing Apex actions to fetch specific Production Batch and Quality Log records. When a user asks about a batch, the agent analyzes the actual, real-time data for that specific batch, ensuring its advice is relevant, accurate, and trustworthy.\n\n2. Strategic Prompt Engineering for Expert-Level Responses:\nWe didn't use generic prompts. We engineered specific \"personas\" for our agent. For quality analysis, it acts as a cautious \"Expert Quality Manager.\" For planning, it's an efficient \"Supply Chain Analyst.\" This prompt strategy resulted in AI responses that were not just correct, but had the tone and focus a real business user would expect.\n\n3. Action-Oriented AI that Drives Collaboration:\nOur most creative use of AI was connecting insight to action. After the AI generates its analysis, we enabled it to publish that critical information directly to a Slack channel. This transforms the AI from a passive \"answer machine\" into an active \"communication hub,\" ensuring the right people see the right information instantly, which is where the true business value lies."

                problemSolution: "The beverage distributor today struggles with manual, reactive sales and delivery processes that leave valuable opportunities unchecked, logistics inefficient, and reps buried in administrative work. Account signals—like under-ordering popular products—slip through the cracks until month-end reviews, while route planning relies on basic tools, wasting time and fuel. Reordering is conservative, waiting on customer requests instead of proactively suggesting restocks, and marketing emails are generic blasts that fail to engage. Altogether, slow sales cycles, suboptimal routes, and under-utilized data throttle growth and stretch reps thin.\nOur solution tightly aligns with these pain points through four AI-driven pillars embedded in Salesforce:\n\nAI Daily Brief Dashboard:\nA scheduled Salesforce Flow sends recent account and order history to Gemini AI each morning. Gemini returns prioritized account recommendations—highlighting under-ordering, upsell opportunities, or high-risk churn signals—displayed on a custom dashboard to focus reps’ efforts.\n\nAutomated Outreach Email:\nFrom an Account quick action, a screen flow retrieves order history via Apex and feeds it into a Flex Prompt template. Gemini crafts a personalized email draft, which the rep reviews and sends from within Salesforce—eliminating manual content creation and ensuring timely, relevant follow-up.\n\nRoute Optimization Alert:\nScenario 1: A scheduled Apex job triggers a flow to collect delivery-date orders and shipping addresses, then invokes a Flex Prompt to generate an optimized Google Maps route link, posts it to Slack, and creates a Delivery record.\n\nScenario 2: An Agentforce Employee Agent accepts a delivery date, runs the same flow, then returns the link to the agent for record creation—enabling on-demand routing.\n\nTrend Insight for Inventory:\nA scheduled Flow passes product-level order data to Gemini, which analyzes stock usage patterns and suggests proactive restocking alerts via email.\n\nBy embedding AI at each step—targeting daily priorities, automating outreach, optimizing logistics, and surfacing inventory trends—this solution transforms reactive processes into proactive, data-driven workflows that boost selling time, reduce waste, and capture more revenue.",

Field engineers log reports, but without real-time interpretation or alerting, response is slow. At the same time, project managers lack a consistent, system-wide view of emerging risks. Daily briefs are often assembled manually, inconsistently, or not at all — reducing confidence, situational awareness, and coordination.\n\nHow We Identified the Gap\nBy reviewing incident logs and day-start routines across roles, we saw two repeated friction points:\nHazards were being recorded — but not escalated.\n\n\nBriefings were being written — but not informed by live system context.\nWe saw an opportunity to address both with targeted, intelligent automation that leveraged existing field data.\n\n\nThe Solution\nWe designed two connected capabilities powered by Salesforce Agentforce:\n\n🛰️ GeoSentinel_Agent (agentic):\nTriggered by new case entries, this Agentforce agent detects hazard types based on field data, checks GIS overlays or weather forecasts via Apex, and raises alerts. If risk is confirmed, it generates a Gemini-based impact summary, creates a follow-up task, and pings the project manager via Slack.\n\n\n🧠 Briefing Intelligence (non-agentic, Gemini-based):\nBuilt using Prompt Builder, this intelligence scans across agent activity logs, tasks, and unresolved case data to produce a clean daily summary. It contextualises site risks, flags stale follow-ups, and delivers briefing content ready for PM dashboards or mobile delivery.\n\n\nTogether, they close the loop between risk detection and risk communication — helping teams act faster and align earlier, without additional manual effort.",
